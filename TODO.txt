TODO: More DM stuff
	- Cars should be on fire on death automatically (easy / done)
	- A proper map to fight on (done)
	- Bot AI (starting / started / needs work but ok for now)
	- Intermission with win condition / fraglimit (done)
	- Add remote bombs, richochet, freeze blast
	- Combo moves + energy meter? (Done)
		- Add: Shield (Done)
	- Skyroom for DM1 (Done)
	- CSQC Radar
	- Figure out a safe way to have rockets push players (done)
	- Remove screen tilt on death (done)
	- Turbo lines should be removed on death/intermission (done)
TODO: Teleporter brush
TODO: Check out the breaking function from shpds delivery game
TODO: Set direct angle on func_vehicle function
TODO: Move checkpoint particles to CSQC and only have the next markers particle effects ran
TODO: Tracebox on cars
	- Works but kind of broken: Maybe reducing the trace by 1's would work? Wheels get stuck
	- Is this needed? Probably not; would be nice to have though...
TODO: Impact sound - Car smash (wall)
TODO: Breakable brushes (request by xaGe)
TODO: Add speed booster as a brush entity as well

====

Done: Work on DM mode
	- Car can fire guns (basic machinegun / specials), machinegun is done
	- Button remappings, done
	- Damage / Kill stuff, Done-ish
Done: Speed Booster 'speed rays', they're more blue
Done: Cap pitch on engine sound
Done: Clip brush Map5 sky just to see how it interacts with the game camera
	- Changes nothing.
Done: Fix bot behavior near goal in map5
Done: Bot/Player interaction with a waypoint snail trail system
Done: Add in TAB scoreboard (+showscores) - FrikBots laps don't update
Done: sound/misc/talk.wav
Done: Check if bot stuck stuff is working correctly
Done: Checkpoint should warp player to original spawn spot if ZERO markers have been touched
Done: Bots know how to use headlights (getlight();)
Done: Speed booster pads
Done: Resize HUD on different resolutions
Done: New collision car->car physics, even if it's fake/lame
Done: Warp car (HACK!)
Done: Car colors / Driver match .colormap
Done: Proper waypoints for bots, if one exists.. they follow it around the course
	- Have 999 waypoint speed tells the AI to turbo, done.
	- Hybrid checkpoint + waypoint system, done.
Done: Add flares to Map4 to help light things a bit
Done: Race4: Moon textures + low graivty + dark (use headlights)
Done: Polish headlights, pflags / white lights instead of DIMLIGHT
Done: Speedlines on turboing
Done: Make checkpoints appear sky-high
Done: Show overall time & best lap on win screen
Done: Particles on tires (dirt)
	- Currently makes dirt particles no matter what, need to get the texture name you're driving on somehow
	- getsurfacenearpoint+getsurfacetexture is unsupported in height maps :(
Done: Warning sound when Turbo'ing and almost out == 10 or <
Done: Race status sent to CSQC
Done: CSQC engine sounds
	- Checks if the player is in the car STAT_DRIVING
Done: Have bots drift to increase turbo, or make them cheat (lame...)
	- Cheating for now
Done: Add "Speed: km/h" + "Drift!"
Done: Allow mapper to set radius size on markers + goal
Done: Attempt to remove car judder, is this possible?
	- Seems to be sv_autooffload 1; or not. - Ongoing Mystery! -
	- Try adding back the 'optimized func_vehicle_builtins.qc' and see what happens now
	- Always judder on player car
	- sv_autoload 0 + opt_func_vehicle_builtins.qc and mintic 0.02 is best
Done: "Float car bug", stick physics issue; player collisions disabled doesn't fix it (but fixes being launched out of the map)
	- Might be fixed with sv_autoload 0 + opt_func_vehicle_builtins.qc and mintic 0.02
Done: Optimize find(); for findradius();
Done: Unglobal CAR_STABILIZER, converted to cardrift_stabilizer
Done: func_vehicle no longer ignores clip/sky brushes *important*
	- hitcontents in phys_exec.qc
Done: Borrow Qrallys "final lap" sound
	- Just made my own instead, along with other voices
Done: Optimize tracelines on func_vehicle for heightmap (WIP/Very difficult)
	- Done by determining which point particles to remove in hotrod(); - Causes camera/car judder?
Done: Polish head lights
Done: Turbo boost SFX
Done: Remove judder off CSQC Chase cam vs func_vehicle
Done: Start/Finish goal flag spawns invisible entity at model base if spawnflag & 1 (Great for heightmap levels)
Done: Freeze all cars in place until the race start countdown ends - locked tires
Done: Impact sound - landing from a jump
Done: Basic shader implementation
Done: "Mapedit" CSAddon terrain support
Done: Developer 1 support
Done: CSQC Chasecam polish
Done: Figure out why centerprints are being "eaten" - 3,2,1, GO can't centerprint
Done: Fix skies on terrain maps
Done: CSQC Chasecam
Done: Turbo Boost
Done: Add misc_model + TAoV's nice trees
Done: T_Damage function implementation
Done: Proper spawning for player + bots
Done: Proper game start - Half done.. needs 3,2,1,Go
Done: info_player_deathmatch should turn into racer_spawnpoint
Done: Have bots figure out if they properly went through the beginning goal
