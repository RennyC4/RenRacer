RenRacer by RenegadeC/RennyC (https://www.youtube.com/@RenegadeC)

Basically a combination of Urre/Polo's func_vehicle mod (https://github.com/TLWmarko/func_vehicle), ReScratched
which is a modified/recovered version of Scratch Tutorials by Ender, and a recovered GoldCup Quake Rally (by Chazz)
and smashed it together as best as I could with some additional improvements.

The GoldCup entities were pretty much entirely rewritten and plays better than the original version, mostly thanks
to func_vehicle, clean source code (progs106 is barely existent at all).

New sound effects were taken from free libraries.

Impulse 1 turns your "headlights" on and off.
+Button1 is Turbo Boost
