RenRacer started off as a combination of Urre/Polo's func_vehicle mod (https://github.com/TLWmarko/func_vehicle),
ReScratched (which is a modified/recovered version of Scratch tutorials by Ender), a recovered GoldCup Quake Rally (by Chazz)
as well as implementing FrikBotX; slowly it's morphing into it's own now.

The GoldCup entities were pretty much entirely rewritten and plays better than the original version, mostly thanks to
func_vehicle, and clean source code.

Impulse 1 toggles your headlights, binded to shift
+Button1 is turbo boost, binded to mouse1 (left mouse button)
+Button2 is handbreak / drift, binded to mouse 2 (right mouse button)
